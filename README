1. INTRODUCTION

SPRotaryProgress is an iOS view that displays a progress in a circular area.
It is an alternative to iOS SDK's progress bar where a square shape fits
better.

2. USAGE

Copy SPProgressView.h, SPProgressView.m, SPProgressLayer.h, SPProgressView.h to
your project.  Add QuartzCore to your target's frameworks.

You can either create the view programatically or with Interface Builder.  With
interface builder, drag a new view ("NewView") into an existing view.  Select
NewView and change it's class to SPProgressView using the identity inspector
(one of the tabs on the right).

You can set the color of the control by assigning UIColors to SPProgressView's
fillColor, strokeColor, and textColor properties.  The percentage is optional,
and can be disabled via the showPercent property.

3. REQUIREMENTS

* iOS SDK (Tested on iOS 5.0 and iOS 4.2)
